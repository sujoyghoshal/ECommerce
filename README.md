- MongoDB installed and running locally

### Steps
<br>

# Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Yogndrr/MERN-Ecommerce-Site.git
```
Open 2 terminals in separate windows/tabs.

Terminal 1: Setting Up Backend 
```sh
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Create a file called .env in the backend folder.
Inside it write this :

```sh
MONGO_URL = mongodb://127.0.0.1/ecommerce

SECRET_KEY = 'secret-key'

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-from-stripe
```
Instead of this link write your database link.

Terminal 2: Setting Up Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
Now, navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser. 
The Backend API will be running at `localhost:5000`.

# Error Solution

If you encounter a network error while signing up, follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Navigate to the `src > redux > userHandle.js` file.

2. Add the following line after the import statements:

```javascript
const REACT_APP_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000";
```

3. Replace all instances of `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` with `REACT_APP_BASE_URL`.

The issue arises because the `.env` file in the frontend may not work for all users, while it works for me.

These steps should resolve the network error in the frontend. If the issue persists, feel free to contact me for further assistance.
